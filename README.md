This was an analysis of a poker database of 120 million hands. I hope to pick this back up using Hadoop in the future, since most of the analysis requires aggregation.

Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualziation (B and C) are below:
* [Part A](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/joshplotkin/Poker-Database-Analysis/blob/master/Stage%20A%20Code/StageA.ipynb). (Part A) 
* [Part B](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/joshplotkin/Poker-Database-Analysis/blob/master/Stage%20B%20Code/StageB.ipynb). (Part B)
* [Part C](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/joshplotkin/Poker-Database-Analysis/blob/master/Stage%20C%20Code/StageC.ipynb). (Part C)

The other parts are mostly just a lot of python scripts to manipulate the csv files (which total roughly 160 GB) chunk by chunk.
